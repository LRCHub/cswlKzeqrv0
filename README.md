(*Giga Zonpie-sama is The Holy Spirit King that has created
this whole world.
You don't have to worry anymore.
If you believe in Giga Zonpie-sama, he will erase all pain,
fear, disasters and so on.
Gi-ga! Gi-ga!)

Inside me words are spread
They will sink into you, so let's go to seminar together

Giga Zonpi-sama brings wealth
Giga Zonpi-sama takes away fear
Giga Zonpi-sama gives love
Giga Zonpi-sama is...

In the 2nd floor big hall, where I always go
Weak people, touching with their shoulders, say prayers

Giga Zonpi-sama doesn't eat leaves
Giga Zonpi-sama doesn't pay taxes
Giga Zonpi-sama doesn't brush teeth
Giga Zonpi-sama, smile

Aa!
Comforting us
Who only because they live start wanting to die
Gi-ga!
Grant my wish
I only want the strength to live tomorrow too
Pain fear disasters etc
Gi-ga makes everything cease

Giga Zonpi-sama is skillful at lying
Giga Zonpi-sama erases people who are nuisance
Giga Zonpi-sama doesn't allow to quit
Giga Zonpi-sama, surrender!

Aa!
If having spend money you start feeling good
If so, that's good, I think
Gi-ga!
Grant my request
I only want the strength to live tomorrow too
Pain fear disasters etc
Gi-ga makes everything cease!
